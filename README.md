Description of AWS concepts like EC2, Elastic Beanstalk


Why did you choose this subject?
- I chose this subject because I am interested in obtaining an opportunity with AWS. I also know that AWS is used in many different tech businesses across many different indistries therefore knowing its services/basic concepts can be useful in an assortment of fields in my future.  

How were you first made aware of it?
When working at my previous company Mercury Analytics. We used a variety of AWS services.

What problem does it solve?
EC2 - gives a platform for resizeable computing capacity on the AWS cloud. It can allow a user to pick the server structure they want based on their potential of desired memory, CPU, GPU or storage. 

Elastic Beanstalk - a platform for quickly making an app that uses AWS features. 


Why does one use it?
EC2 - gives a customizable but reliable source for cloud computing capactiy that is customizable to the client's needs. AWS also has important security features that keep the stored data in safe hands. 


What are the alternatives?
EC2 - When working at mercury we used to have physical servers out in CA that needed to be updated, restarted etc. It was also a smaller company that ran those servers. The positives we found when using AWS is the cost reduction, increase in response time (24hrs a day) and because of their vast expanse of potential servers, if one or many are down, AWS always seems to have a back-up to step in and help with the load. 


Who is maintaining it?
AWS is continuing to improve/maintain these services.

What is your opinion on the technology after having built something with it?
EC2 - I was not able to build something with it but after my research it seems that this would be extremely useful for a larger scale application. Especially one that needs a large amount of computing power / storage.

Elastic Beanstalk - allowed me to quickly deploy and build an application but seems limited to the things that I can do with it / would get much more complicated as the app requirements grow. 


What resources do you recommend for interested students?
EC2 - continue to watch tutorials / concept videos. It seems like a relatively simple idea overall but has a huge amount of applications and therefore has a lot of small differences depending on the use.
